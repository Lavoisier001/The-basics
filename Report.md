    "The introductory class into Python for Data Science was a fascinitating one where my eyes were opened to a lot of things as a beginner. The class introduced us to the basics, starting with the course outline and gradually moving into practical coding concepts.\n",

    " I have learned:\n",
    " 1. The importance of Python as a beginner-friendly language widely used in DATA ANALYSIS,MACHINE LEARNING AND AI.\n",
    " 2. Basic synthax rules in Python, including how to write and run simple programs like;     print(\"data science\").\n",
    " 3. The use of variables for storing values (e.g x = 100, y = 40).\n",
    " 4. Different data types such as integers, floats and strings including bool(Boolean) which has only two possible values viz; TRUE AND FALSE.\n",
    " 5. Basic arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/,//,%) and how to use them in Python.\n",
    " 6. The concept of comparison operators(<,>,==,!=,<=,>=) to evaluate relationships between values and return TRUE or FALSE.\n",
